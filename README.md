# Sin Stock Visualization Project

A case study into the effectiveness of investments into sin stocks. Many impact investment funds have recently popped up, touting a commitment
to socially conscience investments to make the world a better place. In contrast to this investment philosophy exists assets that,
while not necessarily toxic, are considered sinful. Investopedia considers sin stocks an umbrella term, but they usually encompass
companies that operate in “alcohol, tobacco, gambling, sex-related industries, and weapons manufacturers”. Some economist claim that sin stocks, 
due to the dubious nature of their products and services, might actually have their values suppressed due to higher elasticity of investor preferences
and exclusion of potential investors (i.e. pension funds), despite also being potentially recession-proof.

Data was collected from both public resources (i.e. US Labour Statistics) and private resources (i.e. Thomson One). Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib were used for visualization
and data manipulation

*Completed as a final project for Quantitative Economic Modelling with Data Science Applications(ECON 323)*
